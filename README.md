# Populus.JS
## Small JavaScript toolbelt to populate search inputs
![](https://puu.sh/whTn4/44b01b01ae.png)


Who never wanted to have a complete input experience in a frictionless way? Like having action buttons directly in it, the possibility to enable a bulletproof accessibility and else!


### What
Populus.js is a (super-light) JavaScript tool, that, once loaded, will allow you to generate complete input experience, populating them with buttons and other features.


### How
- Load the script
- Write your input with a `populus` tag


### Why
The idea behind is pretty simple.
I'm working at Algolia, and well, we are really (like really really) into search inputs.
I'm building demos, POC, and examples all the time, and I can tell you, the time I'm losing when I have to make a complete input experience is precious.
Now, with Populus.js, I'm able to save that precious time \o/
