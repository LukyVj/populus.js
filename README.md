# POPVLVS.JS
## Small javascript toolbelt to populate search inputs

Who never wanted to have a complete input experience in a frictionless way? Like having action buttons directly in it, the possibility to enable a bulletproof accessibility and else!


### What
POPVLVS is a (super light) JavaScript tool, that, once loaded, will allow you to generate complete input experience, populating them with buttons and other features


### How
- Load the script
- Write your input with a `populus` tag


### Why
The idea behind is pretty simple, I'm working at Algolia, and well, we are really ( like really really ) into search inputs.
I'm building demos, POC, and examples all the time, and I can tell you, the time I'm losing when I have to make a complete input experience is precious.
Now, with POPVLVS, I'm able to save that precious time \o/


### Thanks
Thanks to @auareyou for the design and the precious advices and help


### Development
- clone the repo
- `cd path/to/popvlvs`
